Node Express Handlebars 


Coding Bootcamp Spring of 2018 GA Tech


By: Thomas Gentle

Overview:

In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.



Notes: This code is not complete. Missing encryption and packages. Needs debugging. Take what you can from it :)
